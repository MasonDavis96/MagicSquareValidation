# Magic Square
A program focused on the utilization of threads to validate each individual row, column and diagonal of a square of numbers to determine if it is a 'magic square' or not<br><br>


# What I Learned
* Threads (execution, scheduler)<br><br>


# Usage
Run Command:<br>

`javac *.java`<br>
`java MagicSquare square.txt`<br><br>

The 'square.txt' file must be a geometric square of numbers, but can be of variable size. It will not work for uneven row/column counts.<br><br>
